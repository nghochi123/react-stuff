# This app was built with Create React App under Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React course

## Features

Through this course and building this app, I learnt React's base features and syntax, as well as how to use CSS stylings on React components. In the end the most comfortable for me is to either use CSS module or just use plain CSS.

For more advanced features, I learnt to work with Redux, routing in React as well as some basic authentication, as well as React Hooks.

I also learnt how to work with testing modules like Jest and Enzyme 

## Requests

I also learnt how to use npm modules to make requests to the web with React, as well as to interact with APIs and databases like Firebase.
